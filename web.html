            What’s more, musicians will (or at least modern musicians have the
            opportunity to) learn about their niche area through metadata
            analysis and find out what makes the fans tick, so that they can
            pick up on this connection between music maker and listener. As
            such, how can you really be sure that the person playing the drums,
            strumming on the guitar or singing the song on your favourite album
            is actually feeling the music in the magical way we’d like to think
            they are?

          <h1>HAPPY BIRTHDAY, JIMMY PAGE</h1>
          <p>
            The music that Jimmy Page made was able to transport you so that you
            got lost in what he was playing. His solos were show-stopping and so
            innovative when it came to guitar-playing technique at the time. He
            set himself the challenge of breaking the preconceptions of what a
            guitar can do, so his style evolved over time. But he was always one
            of the greats, even when experimenting!<br /><br />A canonical
            guitarist.
